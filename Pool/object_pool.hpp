/**
   from https://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/sandbox/pool rev 83408.

   necessary because boost trunk pool has no maintainer (since 2002)

   changed slightly by graehl:

   I reverted their amendment of the original pool interface (which allowed freeing
   of null pointers), and their optimization for "when all objects were freed,
   don't waste time scanning for unfreed objects" - if you really will free
   everything, don't use an object_pool!

   I also tuned default block size to fit (with pool and TBB allocator overhead)
   8kb. This is important because the old default of 32*sizeof(object) for
   extremely large objects might leave significant wasted space in a TBB 16kb slab.

   the default number of objects to allocate is automatically tuned to fill
   POOL_MALLOC_BLOCK_TARGET with the boost::pool overhead in
   mind. POOL_MALLOC_BLOCK_TARGET will be set so that we can fit two blocks on a
   TBB malloc slab (which is 16kb)

   ---

   advice:

   do *not* explicitly destroy everything you've allocated; it's slower than
   letting the destructor do it, or else use a raw Pool::pool and handle
   construct/destruct yourself, because in order to keep track of what needs
   automatic destructor calls, there's an O(m+n*lg n) cost, where m is high
   water mark of total objects allocated, and n is the size of the free list (so
   if you keep close to peek occupancy, it's actually *faster*).

   ----

   TODO: i believe i can make this approx O(m) with a little up-front overhead,
   for objects of larger than sizeof(void *):

    1. after destroy and on fresh segregation of a new never-allocated block,
   write a constant random-like magic number right after the free-list pointer.

    2. then on object_pool purge_memory, scan through the O(m) (object or
   freelist+magic), creating (in a temporary vector) a list of pointers to
   everything matching the magic number. you can destroy any non-magic (must be
   live object) right now.

    3. iterate over the free list, clearing the magic number

    4. iterate again over the magic-matching objects in 2 (note: the list of
    magic-matched objects was actually optional). these are objects that
    happened to (unfortunately) match the magic number. destroy them now

   whether this is actually faster is an empirical question, but i guess that
   the size of the false-magic-number match set is nearly 0 on average. so the
   extra cost would mostly be in marking the magic number in newly acquired
   simple_segregated_storage and on destroy.

   the current approach is faster if you have very many construct/destroy in a
   steady state (the amount held grows slowly and then asymptotes). in this case
   m would be large but n, the free list size, would be small. the current
   approach has minimal per-construct/destroy overhead (though writing a magic
   number is pretty cheap)

   a bitvector approach (where the bitvector is allocated only on destroying an
   object_pool) would work if we modified the pool/simple_segregated_storage to
   give us a global index across all blocks, or a way to associate a separate
   vector w/ each block. magic numbers are likely faster, though.

/*! \brief A template class
that can be used for fast and efficient memory allocation of objects.
It also provides automatic destruction of non-deallocated objects.

\details

<b>T</b> The type of object to allocate/deallocate.
T must have a non-throwing destructor.

<b>UserAllocator</b>
Defines the allocator that the underlying Pool will use to allocate memory from the system.
See <a href="boost_pool/pool/pooling.html#boost_pool.pool.pooling.user_allocator">User Allocators</a> for details.

Class object_pool is a template class
that can be used for fast and efficient memory allocation of objects.
It also provides automatic destruction of non-deallocated objects.

When the object pool is destroyed, then the destructor for type T
is called for each allocated T that has not yet been deallocated. O(N).

Whenever an object of type ObjectPool needs memory from the system,
it will request it from its UserAllocator template parameter.
The amount requested is determined using a doubling algorithm;
that is, each time more system memory is allocated,
the amount of system memory requested is doubled.
Users may control the doubling algorithm by the parameters passed
to the object_pool's constructor.
